## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common language used to manipulate and manage data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database").

SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel."

Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. SQLite is a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries. MySQL is the most commonly use variant, because it's easy to use and good for smaller projects.
